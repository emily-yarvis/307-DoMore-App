We are using the standard style conventions in Prettier.

Make sure to install the following plugins to your IDE to ensure code style is the same:

1. Prettier
2. Prettier ESLint

In order for these plugins to format your code on save follow these steps: https://blog.yogeshchavan.dev/automatically-format-code-on-file-save-in-visual-studio-code-using-prettier

Make sure to run these commands:

##frontend:
npm install vite

##backend:

Make sure to run npm install --save-dev --save-exact-prettier in the root of your cloned repo.
